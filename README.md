# Recipe-app
Programme written using the Edamam API for my Code First Girls Python and Apps coding kickstarter project

The programme searches the API for an ingredient and returns results in a text file. 
Results are sorted from least to most of the specified ingredient.
Results are filtered by meal time and dietary requirement, with the recipe name, ingredient list and a link to the site the recipe was taken from.
